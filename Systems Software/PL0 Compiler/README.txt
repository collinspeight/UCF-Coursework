Project Description: Create a compiler for the PL/0 programming language. Write the virtual machine, parser, and lexer and then merge them into a working compiler.

Timeline: Approx. 3 months

NOTES:
	- Completed in a group
	- All individual parts work well on their own but are buggy when merged together.
